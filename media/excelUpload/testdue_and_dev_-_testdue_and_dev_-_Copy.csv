1,DDE-DLA/TRT-HZD-001,CRA,DLA-TRC,DDE,"SIPROD -Wellhead and conductors:
- Corrosion
- Well intervention equipment failure
- Erosion
- Marine collision (standby boat, supply boat, passing vessels, tug boat) against conductor
- Operator error
- Uncontrolled / sudden surge from well 
resulting in condition outside of design 
envelope / overpressure 
- Loss of annulus integrity
- Uneven and excessive subsidence leading to mechanical failure of conductors","Uncontrolled HC release from well/ blowout leading to potential fire/ explosion causing multiple personnel fatalities (when personnel present on platform), asset damage/production loss and environment (if unignited).","1. Well design specification in accordance to reservoir and Metocean condition, in line with PPGUA.
2. Adequate material selection based on material selection study.
3. Corrosion management plan (cathodic protection, splash zone coating for conductors).
4. Marine procedures.
5. 500m safety exclusion zone and procedures to intervene errant vessels.
6. Conductor located within jacket structure.
7. Barge bumper.

2,DDE-DLA/TRT-HZD-002,CRA,DLA-TRC,DDE,"Export riser / flexible pipeline from DLA WHA / TRT WHC to subsea tie-in:
- Overpressure due to blocked discharge (i.e. due to stuck pig) or hydrate formation
- Corrosion 
- Impact from dropped objects onto pipeline
- External impact from ship / boat collision 
onto riser
- Anchor drop / drag on pipeline
- Inadequate/ poor pipeline inspection
- Fishing vessel interaction (e.g. Trawling)
","Potential prolonged riser jet fire at DLA WHA/TRT WHC leading to asset damage and personnel injuries / fatalities. May potentially cause escalation to topsides equipment and structures. Unignited release will lead to flammable gas cloud that could engulf large portion of process topsides. In the event of subsea release, the worst case consequence could be gas sea pool fire (sea surface fires).","1. Design Specifications for pipeline.
2. High High and Low Low Pressure Trip Function for export pipeline ( Independent transmitter for IPPPS).
